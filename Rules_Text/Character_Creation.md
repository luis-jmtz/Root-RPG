## Character Creation Rules

#### Step 1: Attributes & Prime Modifier

**Prime Modifier**: Your Prime Modifier is equal to your PC's highest Attribute. 

#### Attribute Limit
You can increase your Attributes as you gain levels, however you can’t increase an Attribute past the Attribute Limit. The Attribute Limit increases at certain levels as shown in the table below. You can increase an Attribute at the same level that your Attribute Limit increases

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 1        | 3               |
| 5        | 4               |
