# Maplewood: an Maplewood TTRPG spin-off

## Dice: 
Maplewood primarily uses a d20 for gameplay, but players should also have at least one of each of the following: d4, d8, d10, and d12.

## Advantage/Disadvantage (ADV/DIS): 
Certain abilities or situations may grant you a level of Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DIS). You can have up to 3 stacks of ADV or DIS at a time. Each ADV cancels out one DIS and vice versa. For every stack of ADV you have, roll one additional die and use the highest result. For every stack of DIS you have, roll one additional die and use the lowest result.

## Attributes:
Maplewood features 4 attributes that define your character:
- Might (Mgt): Represents physical strength and fortitude.
- Dexterity (Dex): Reflects agility, flexibility, and balance.
- Intelligence (Int): Measures knowledge and mental acuity.
- Charisma (Cha): Captures your ability to understand and influence others.

The value of an attribute is added to relevant skills and defenses.

### Prime Attribute:
Your Prime Attribute is your highest Attribute value.

## Proficiency:
Proficiency represents your skill with a variety of Skill and Equipment. Your Proficiency Bonus is equal to **1 + ½ your character's level (rounded down)**. If you are Proficient with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to the Attack Roll. You also add your Proficiency Bonus to Spell Attacks. When using Armor or a Shield without Proficeincy, you have DIS on any Attribute Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Check.


## Rounding Rules:
Always round down when calculating values, with a minimum result of 1. 

## Action Points (AP):
Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain Action Points at the **end of your turn**. In combat, you can spend additional AP to give yourself ADV on an Attack check. 

## Degrees of Success:
When your d20 roll’s total meets or exceeds the target number (DC or AC), you succeed. For every 5 points your total exceeds the target, you gain one Degree of Success. Conversely, for every 5 points your total falls short of the target, you gain one Degree of Failure. 
The specific effects of these Degrees are determined by the context of the roll. Most commonly, on a Weapon Attack, each Degree of Success deals +1 additional damage to the target. On a Saving Throw against a damaging effect, each Degree of Failure causes +1 additional damage.

### Difficulty Challenge (DC): 
The Difficulty Challenge (DC) represents how hard it is to succeed at a particular task. When attempting to overcome a challenge, your total roll (including all modifiers) must be equal to or greater than the DC to succeed.

### Multiple Check Penalty: 
During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DIS on that type of Check. This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature’s turn, and doesn’t apply to Reactions taken on another creature’s turn (unless otherwise stated).
- When taking multiple Move actions, instead of adding a stack of DIS, a creature's Speed is halved for that Move action.
- If you're holding an Action, it is still affected by the Multiple Check Penalty

### Helping another Creature 
#### Helping Outside of Combat
When outside of combat you can choose to help a creature succeed on a check if it makes sense. When you do so, the target of the Help Action adds a d8 to that check. Multiple creatures may attempt to Help a creature if it makes since in the situation. If multiple creatures Help with the check the dice size gets smaller after each creature, starting at a d8 then d6 then d4. The GM may rule that a creature must succeed on a check before they are able to help another. For example, if a Wizard is making an Arcane Check with a DC 15, the GM may rule that any creature that wishes to help must succeed on a DC 10 Arcane roll to Help.

#### Help Action in Combat
Unless otherwise stated, you must be adjacent to a creature to give them the Help Action in combat. You can spend 1 AP to grant an ally a d8 Help Die until the start of your next turn. You must declare the target creature and the type of Check you're aiding.
