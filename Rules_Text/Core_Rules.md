# Core Rules
### Dice: 
Maplewood primarily uses a d20 for gameplay, but players should also have at least one of each of the following: d4, d8, d10, and d12.

### Advantage/Disadvantage (ADV/DIS): 
Certain abilities or situations may grant you a level of Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DIS). You can have up to 3 stacks of ADV or DIS at a time. Each ADV cancels out one DIS and vice versa. For every stack of ADV you have, roll one additional die and use the highest result. For every stack of DIS you have, roll one additional die and use the lowest result.

### Attributes:
Maplewood features 4 attributes that define your character:
- Might (Mgt): Represents physical strength and fortitude.
- Dexterity (Dex): Reflects agility, flexibility, and balance.
- Intelligence (Int): Measures knowledge and mental acuity.
- Charisma (Cha): Captures your ability to understand and influence others.

The value of an attribute is added to relevant skills and defenses.

#### Prime Attribute:
Your Prime Attribute is your highest Attribute value.

### Proficiency:
Proficiency represents your skill with a variety of Skill and Equipment. Your Proficiency Bonus is equal to **1 + ½ your character's level (rounded down)**. If you are Proficient with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to the Attack Roll. You also add your Proficiency Bonus to Spell Attacks. When using Armor or a Shield without Proficeincy, you have DIS on any Attribute Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Check.


### Rounding Rules:
Always round down when calculating values, with a minimum result of 1. 

### Action Points (AP):
Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain Action Points at the **end of your turn**. In combat, you can spend additional AP to give yourself ADV on an Attack check. 

### Degrees of Success:
When your d20 roll’s total meets or exceeds the target number (DC or AC), you succeed. For every 5 points your total exceeds the target, you gain one Degree of Success. Conversely, for every 5 points your total falls short of the target, you gain one Degree of Failure. 
The specific effects of these Degrees are determined by the context of the roll. Most commonly, on a Weapon Attack, each Degree of Success deals +1 additional damage to the target. On a Saving Throw against a damaging effect, each Degree of Failure causes +1 additional damage.

### Difficulty Challenge (DC): 
The Difficulty Challenge (DC) represents how hard it is to succeed at a particular task. When attempting to overcome a challenge, your total roll (including all modifiers) must be equal to or greater than the DC to succeed.
#### Failing Skill Checks
Skill checks represent your character's best attempt under pressure. Failure does not mean your character is incompetent. Instead, it reflects the unpredictable nature of action. A failed check often means the task was more complex than it appeared—perhaps the lock is rusted shut, the merchant is in a foul mood and unreceptive to charm, or the ancient text is deliberately encoded. It can also mean you succeeded but at a significant cost, took too long, attracted unwanted attention, or only partially completed your goal, leaving you exposed or requiring a new approach. In this way, failure drives the story forward by introducing new complications and challenges, rather than simply halting progress.

### Multiple Check Penalty: 
During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DIS on that type of Check. This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature’s turn, and doesn’t apply to Reactions taken on another creature’s turn (unless otherwise stated).
- When taking multiple Move actions, instead of adding a stack of DIS, a creature's Speed is halved for that Move action.
- If you're holding an Action, it is still affected by the Multiple Check Penalty

### Helping another Creature 
#### Helping Outside of Combat
When outside of combat you can choose to help a creature succeed on a check if it makes sense. When you do so, the target of the Help Action adds a d8 to that check. Multiple creatures may attempt to Help a creature if it makes since in the situation. If multiple creatures Help with the check the dice size gets smaller after each creature, starting at a d8 then d6 then d4. The GM may rule that a creature must succeed on a check before they are able to help another. For example, if a Wizard is making an Arcane Check with a DC 15, the GM may rule that any creature that wishes to help must succeed on a DC 10 Arcane roll to Help.

#### Help Action in Combat
Hit Points measure your character’s stamina, luck, and resolve in combat. While you have HP remaining, you have avoided any serious physical wounds. Losing HP represents near misses, glancing blows, and mounting fatigue.

### Hit Points and Vitality
#### Hit Points (HP)
Hit Points represent your character's ability to get hit and keep going. It is effectively a combination of your character's stamina and willingness to continue to fight. While you have Hit Points remaining, it is assumed your character has not taken any lethal or debilitating wounds. 
#### Vitality
When your Hit Points are reduced to zero, any further damage targets your Vitality instead. Your Vitality score is equal to your Proficiency Bonus.   

Losing Vitality represents receiving serious harm. The first time you take Vitality damage per a Long Rest, you immediately gain one level of Exhaustion. You naturally regain 1 point of Vitality at the end of a Long Rest. If your Vitality is ever reduced to zero, your character dies.`


### Resting
#### Quick Rest
A Quick Rest requires at least 30 minutes of light activity, such as eating, reading, or resting. During this time, you cannot engage in strenuous tasks. Upon finishing a Quick Rest, you regain up to half your maximum Hit Points and all of your Focus Points. You may benefit from a Quick Rest no more than twice before completing a Long Rest.

#### Long Rest
A Long Rest lasts at least 8 hours, during which you must spend at least 6 hours sleeping. When you complete a Long Rest, you regain all your Hit Points and Focus Points, and you also receive the benefits of any abilities that would normally apply after a Quick Rest. You can gain the benefits of a Long Rest only once every 24 hours.

If you go without a Long Rest for a full 24-hour period, you must succeed on a Might saving throw (DC 13 + number of days since your last Long Rest) or gain one level of Exhaustion.
