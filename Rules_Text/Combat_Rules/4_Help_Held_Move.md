**Help (1 AP)**   
Unless otherwise stated, you must be adjacent to a creature to give them the Help Action in combat. You can spend 1 AP to grant an ally a d8 Help Die until the start of your next turn. You must declare the target creature and the type of Check you're aiding.  
The Help Die is consumed when used and applies only to the declared Check.

*Multiple Help Penalty*: Each additional Help Action taken before the end of your turn reduces subsequent Help Dice by one step (d8, d6, d4).

**Held Actions**
When combat conditions aren't optimal for your intended action, you may hold it for later execution. This Held Action is considered a Reaction:
1. Declare Action and Pay Cost: Immediately spend the required AP for your chosen action. All Multiple Check Penalties from your current turn apply to this Reaction.
2. Specify Trigger Condition: Define an observable game event that will activate your held action, such as "when the orc enters melee range" or "after my ally moves to safety." This trigger cannot be altered once set.
3. Resolve when Triggered: If the trigger occurs before your next turn, you may interrupt the event to execute your action as a Reaction. Any additional resource costs are paid at activation. The AP is lost if the trigger doesn't occur.

**Move Action (1 AP)**   
When you take the Move Action you can move a number of spaces equal to your Speed. You can split your Move action. Example: If you have 6 Speed, you can move 3 spaces, attack, and then move 3 spaces away. 

You can take more than one Move Action per round, but each time you do, your Speed is halved. You cannot take the Move Action more than 3 times.
- 1st Move Action: You move your Speed
- 2nd Move Action: You move half your Speed
- 3rd Move Action: You move a quarter of your Speed
