**Help (1 AP)**   
Unless otherwise stated, you must be adjacent to a creature to give them the Help Action in combat. You can spend 1 AP to grant an ally a d8 Help Die until the start of your next turn. You must declare the target creature and the type of Check you're aiding.  
The Help Die is consumed when used and applies only to the declared Check.

*Multiple Help Penalty*: Each additional Help Action taken before the end of your turn reduces subsequent Help Dice by one step (d8, d6, d4).
