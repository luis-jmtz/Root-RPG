### Offensive Actions

---

**Attack (1 AP)**   
You make 1 Attack Check. For each additional AP you use, you gain a level of ADV.   

On an Attack Check, there are additional terms and effects when your total Attack Check (d20 + Attack Bonus + any applicable abilities) has a Degree of Success:
- Heavy Hit: 5 or more above the target AC.
- Brutal Hit: 10 or more above the target AC. You ignore any Resistences from the target's armor. 

---

**Disarm (1 AP)**   
Choose a creature within your weapon’s range. Make an Attack Check, and the target contests it using either Athletics, Acrobatics, or Sleight of Hand. If your Attack Check succeeds, the target drops the object they are holding.

The target gains Advantage for every additional limb they are using to hold the object. Additionally, you have Disadvantage if the target is larger than you, or Advantage if the target is smaller than you. However, you cannot target a creature that is two size categories larger or smaller than you.

**Shove (1 AP)**   
You attempt to push a creature within 1 Space of you. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Physical Check. On a success, you push the creature 1 Space away from you or to its left or right. For every 5 points your roll exceeds the target’s roll, you can push the creature 1 additional Space. After resolving the push, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.

**Tackle (1 AP)**   
If you move at least 2 Spaces in a straight line, you can attempt to Tackle a creature that’s your size or smaller. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Martial Check. On a success, you Grapple the target, and you both move 1 Space in the same direction you were moving. Immediately after moving, you and the target fall Prone.

---

**Grapple (1 AP)**   
If you have a free hand, you can attempt to Grapple a creature. To do this, make an Athletics check contested by the targeted creature's Physical Check. 
- You have ADV on the check if you are larger than the target and DIS if you are smaller than the target. You cannot Target creatures that are two or more size categories larger or smaller than you. 
- On a success, the target creature has the Grappled condition (Speed becomes 0 and DIS on Dexterity Saves and Checks).

*Ending a Grapple*  
There are multiple ways for a Grapple to end:
- Escaping a Grapple: A creature spend 1 AP to attempt to break free. It makes a Physical Check contested by the Grappler’s Athletics Check.
- Incapacitated Grappler: If the Grappler becomes Incapacitated, the Grapple immediately ends.
- Forced Movement:
	- If an effect attempts to forcibly move a creature beyond the Grappler’s reach, the Grappler makes the Check or Save instead of the grappled creature.
	- If the effect targets both the creature and the Grappler, the Grappler makes 1 Check or Save for both creatures.
	- Success: Neither are moved.
	- Failure: The Grapple ends, and the effect moves both creatures as intended.
- Falling: If the grappled creature begins Falling while Grappled, and the Grappler is not falling with it, the Grappler hold the grappled creature in place if they can carry its weight.

**Coup de Grace (3 AP)**
A Coup de Grace (also known as a Killing Blow), is a particularly lethal strike against a creature. You can perform a Coup de Grace if all of the following conditions are met.
- The target creature is under the effects of at least one of the following conditions:
  - Incapacitated
  - Paralyzed
  - Stun 4 (or Stunned to the point of having no AP)
  - Unconscious
- You are not within the Melee range of a creature currently aggressive to you.
- You do not have DIS on Attack Checks against the target creature.
- The target creature is not Immune to Critical Hits.
- The target is not more than 1 Size category larger than you.   
 
When you take a Coup de Grace, you automatically land a Critical Hit against the target. You also calculate 20 + your Attack Bonus, to determine additional damage from Degrees of Success. Your Attack automatically counts as Heavy or Brutal hit for the purpose of any of your abilities.   

The target must make a Might Save whose DC is equal to *10 + the total damage you did against the target*. If the target fails the Save, it immediately gains a level of *Exhaustion*. It gains 1 additional level of *Exhaustion* for every Degree of failure.
