### Time in Combat
Time in combat is measured in Rounds. Each Round is 6 seconds.

### Surprise
Combat begins only when the GM instructs the players to roll for initiative. However, players and NPCs may use stealth or other tactics to gain an advantage before combat starts. If one group is caught off guard, they gain the Surprised condition and automatically fail their initiative checks.

Surprised Condition: When you have the Surprised condition you can't spend Action Points and are Exposed (Attack checks against them have ADV)

### Action Points (AP):
Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default, but some creatures may have fewer or more. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain Action Points at the end of your turn. 

### Actions and Reactions in Combat
Anything that requires spending Action Points (AP) is considered an Action if it occurs during your turn. To take an Action, you must spend the AP cost specified in the Action’s description. If you spend Action Points outside of your turn, it is considered a Reaction. Reactions usually require a specific trigger, such as an enemy moving out of range or an ally being attacked, and they also have an AP cost outlined in their description.

#### Free Object Interactions
Once per turn, you can perform a simple, quick action that does not require spending AP. This is called a Free Object Interaction.
 Examples include:
-  picking up a small item
- retrieving or storing something on your person
- pulling a lever.

These rules are intentionally flexible to accommodate a variety of situations. If there is any uncertainty about whether an action qualifies as a Free Object Interaction, the group can discuss it, but the GM has the final say.

- Additional Object Interactions: If you want to perform more than one object interaction in a turn, you can spend 1 AP to do so.
