### Initiative Rules
At the start of combat, each group of combatants makes a Contested Group Check to determine turn order. This check uses the Initiative Bonus of each creature, with a default Difficulty Challenge (DC) of 13. However, the DC may vary based on factors such as environmental conditions, like bad weather, or other situational modifiers. Each Degree of Success or Failure from the roll adds a adds or subtracts from a a group's total number of success respectively.

The group with the higher number of successes wins and acts first at the beginning of each round. Combat follows an alternating activation system, where a member of one group takes their turn, followed by a member of the opposing group, continuing this pattern until all participants have acted. The actual order of activation within each group is decided by the DM and players respectively, and it can change from round to round. The group that wins the Contested Group Check decides which of their members acts first. In the event of a tie, the DM resolves turn order based on context or by rolling to break the tie. 

#### Initiative Bonus
Each player has an Initiative Bonus, calculated as follows:
- Initiative Bonus = Highest Physical Attribute (Might or Dexterity) + Proficiency.  

#### Uneven number of Creatures
When one group of combatants outnumbers the other, the larger group activates in smaller sub-groups to maintain balance. This ensures that each side alternates turns evenly, with the larger group dividing its activations across the round as needed.
