### Collisions
When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another creature, it takes damage upon impact.
- Spaces: A creature stops in the Space where it made contact with the object or creature.
- Damage: A creature takes an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it couldn’t travel (due to the collision).
- Creature Collision: If a thrown creature or falling creature collides with another creature they both share the damage (each take half)

#### Falling Attacks
If you want to put more force into an Attack Check, you can purposefully fall onto a target as part of your Attack Check. To do this, you first need to move into a position to fall onto the target. Using the Creature Collision rules from above, you would count up the Spaces fallen and this number will represent the falling damage that will be taken. You can now make your Attack Check and resolve the damage based on the result. Then (regardless of if you hit or miss) you would share the damage taken from the fall. You would take half of the damage and the other half would be added to the damage they take as part of the same Attack Check.

### Throwing Creatures
You can spend 1 AP to throw a creature that’s Grappled by you that’s the same size as you or smaller. Make an Athletics Check Contested by the target’s Physical Check. *Success*: You throw the creature up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest by.
- Smaller Size: If the creature is a size smaller than you, the distance thrown is equal to your Might (instead of half).
- Vertical Toss: You can choose throw the creature vertically into the air. When you do, they distance thrown is halved.
- Team Throw: If another creature has the same target Grappled, that other creature can spend 1 AP as a reaction to throw the target with you. You and the other creature each make an Athletics Check and add your results together to determine the total number of Spaces the target is thrown.
- Throw at a Target: If you throw a creature at a target, you must make an Athletics Check and compare it to the target’s AC. Hit: The thrown creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half) Miss: The thrown creature continues traveling up to the distance thrown or until it impacts an immovable object (such as a wall) and takes full Collision damage.

### Dual Wielding
You are considered to be **Dual Wielding** when you have 2 free hands or 2 hands wielding 1-Handed Weapons. While Dual Wielding, when you make an Attack with one hand followed be a second Attack with the other hand, the 2nd Attack ignores the Multiple Check Penalty and doesn't advance that penalty.
