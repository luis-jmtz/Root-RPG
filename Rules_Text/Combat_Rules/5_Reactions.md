### Reactions

Reactions are types actions taken in response to specific triggers during another creature's turn. A creature cannot normally take reactions during its own turn unless responding to another reaction.

Taking Reactions:
To take a reaction, a creature must meet both:  
- The prerequisite (required feature like Martial)  
- The trigger condition (specific game event)  
Only one reaction can be taken per trigger instance. For example, when an enemy leaves your reach, only one opportunity attack may be made regardless of available action points.

**Action Point Costs**  
Spending AP on reactions reduces your available AP pool on your next turn:  
- AP spent on reactions isn't refunded until your turn ends  
- If all AP is spent before your turn, you begin with 0 AP  
- Multiple different reactions may be taken if triggers occur and AP is available


#### Attacks of Opportunity
*Prerequisite:* Martial Feature   
*Trigger:* When a visible creature within your melee range:  
- Moves out of your reach  
- Stands up from prone  
- Picks up an object   

You can take an Attack Action against the creature. You only suffer from the Multiple Check Penalty if you have taken other Attack Actions as Reactions. Attack actions during your turn do not contribute to the Multiple Check Penalty for Reactions.
