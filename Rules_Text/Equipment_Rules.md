### Currency
The world of ROOT has no universal currency. With multiple factions via for control and trying to impose their own coin, most dwellers of the Deepwoods rely on simple bartering

As a result, each item has a generic *Value* to roughly represent what it is worth. For reference, a day's worth of standard rations would be about 1 *Value*.

### Inventory Rules

Regardless of a Player's Attributes or abilities, each PC has 10 Inventory Slots. Most items take a single Inventory Slot.

Some items like the Quiver allow you to hold multiple of a certain type of item. In the case of the Quiver, it allows you to hold all of your Arrows or Bolts in a single Inventory Slot.

Note: You do have to track each piece of ammunition within the Quiver.
